---

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Relic Management
- Edit existing Relics  
- Replace Relics  
- Modify Relic effect IDs and values  
- Delete Relics  
- Export & import Relics via **Excel**  
- One-click fix illegal Relics if fixable 

### 💎 Save Editing
- Edit **Murks** and **Sigs**
- Import full save files or individual characters
- Improved **illegal relic detection**
- Multi-language support

### 🛡️ Automatic Backup System
To ensure data safety, the editor performs an automatic backup every time a save file is opened.

* **Cycle Backups**: The system automatically stores backups in the `/backup` folder within the application directory. It maintains the **5 most recent versions** on a rolling basis.
* **Root Backup (Protected)**: 
    * The system creates a one-time **"Root" backup** that will never be overwritten.
    * **For new users**: This serves as a permanent copy of your "Pure" (unmodified) save.
    * **For existing users**: This acts as a "Last Resort" recovery point to prevent permanent save corruption.

### ⚙️ Vessel and Preset Management

* **Relic Configuration**: Customize and edit Relic combinations for both Vessels and Presets.
* **Save as Preset**: Quickly save your current Vessel configuration as a Preset.
* **Loadout Export**: Export the specific loadout of a selected character for backup or sharing.
* **Selective Loadout Import**: Import specific loadouts with a flexible selection tool.
* **Safe Relic Auto-Addition**: When importing a loadout containing Relics not present in your save, the system will automatically add them (excluding **Unique Relics**).
* **Vessel Unlock Detection**: Automatically detects the unlock status of various Vessels.
    > **Note**: Character unlock parsing is currently a work in progress. By default, the initial Vessels for all characters are marked as "Unlocked."

#### 🔍 Definition: Unique Relics
To **avoid violation detection**, the system will not auto-generate **Unique Relics**. These are defined as:
* Relics obtained by **defeating Bosses**.
* Relics purchased from the **'Small Jar Bazaar'** or the **'Collector Signboard'**.

#### ⚠️ Important Usage Notes
* **Deep Mode & Deep Relics**: There is currently no complete detection mechanism for Deep Mode/Deep Relic unlock status. 
* **Recommendation**: It is highly recommended to **manually unlock Deep Mode in-game** before importing other players' loadouts to ensure compatibility.
